# Image Classification using TensorFlow

## About
This project addresses the need for automated classification of fashion items based on type and gender. Specifically, it focuses on categorizing images of trousers and jeans into four distinct classes:

1. **Male Trousers**  
2. **Female Trousers**  
3. **Male Jeans**  
4. **Female Jeans**

The classification process utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow. The model extracts key features from images to distinguish subtle differences in clothing type (e.g., jeans vs. trousers) and gender-specific design patterns. By leveraging advanced data preprocessing techniques and deep learning, this solution delivers high accuracy and robust performance on unseen data.

The project is ideal for applications in:
- Fashion e-commerce platforms for better product categorization.
- Inventory management systems to organize clothing by type and gender.
- Search and recommendation systems for personalized shopping experiences.

This repository provides a step-by-step workflow, from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and visualization, making it a valuable resource for learning and solving similar classification problems.
## Overview
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, used in applications ranging from medical imaging to autonomous driving. This project uses TensorFlow to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of classifying images into predefined categories. 

## Highlights of the Jupyter Notebook
The notebook is structured into the following sections:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loading the dataset and splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zoom to increase dataset variability and prevent overfitting.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
   - Implementation of a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - The network includes:
     - **Convolutional layers** for feature extraction.
     - **Pooling layers** for dimensionality reduction.
     - **Dropout layers** for regularization.
     - **Dense layers** for classification.
   - Transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) is also explored to improve performance.

### 3. **Callbacks**
   - **Learning rate scheduler**: Adjusts the learning rate dynamically during training to optimize convergence.
   - **Early stopping**: Stops training once the validation performance stops improving to save computational resources.
   - **Model checkpoint**: Saves the best-performing model during training.

### 4. **Training**
   - Comprehensive training process with visualization of metrics such as loss and accuracy over epochs.
   - Batch size and optimizer configurations to ensure efficient learning.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluation of the model on the test dataset with detailed performance metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
   - Visualization of the confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications.

### 6. **Predictions and Visualization**
   - Testing the model on unseen images.
   - Visualization of predictions along with confidence scores for better interpretability.

## Models Used
- **Custom CNN**: A basic convolutional neural network built from scratch to classify images.
- **Transfer Learning Models**: Pre-trained models such as MobileNet and ResNet are fine-tuned on the dataset to leverage their feature extraction capabilities.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy on the validation and test datasets.
- Visualized training and validation curves to ensure the model avoids overfitting.
- Confusion matrix analysis provides insights into the performance for each class.

## Callbacks and Regularization
